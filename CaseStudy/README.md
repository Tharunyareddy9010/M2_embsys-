# Introduction
As we know, there are different types of communications in the control system to control the home appliances, industrial appliances, etc.
In general, we use two different types of communication one is wired and other one is wireless communication.
In our project “DTMF Based Home System” we will be using a wireless control system to control the home appliances.

# HIGH LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION

| ID  | High level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| HL1  |Recognising the voice commands|
| HL2  | Storing the data  |
| HL3  | controlling the appliances  |


# LOW LEVEL IMPLEMTATION
| ID  | Low level requirements |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| H1L1  |Recognizing the call using DTMF |
| H2L1  | Storing the data into cloud  |
| H3L1  | using the microcontroller to control appliances |
# SENSOR AND ACCUTATORS
Arduino Nano Microcontroller - It is an eight (8) bit Microcontroller. It can handle the data sized of up to eight (8) bits. It operates ranging from 3.3V.

DTMF - It can detect voice calls and act as input for microcontrollers

Relay - It is an electrically operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch.



Light Bulbs - used in the house hold these are controlled by the system.

# APPLICATIONS
- It is used in industries and factories.
- It is used to control appliances with long range
-  It can be used in areas where internet connectivity is poor
